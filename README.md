👋 Hi, I'm Marco

I’m an open source developer obsessed with building bulletproof tools that feel effortless to use.

---

🔭 **What I'm working on**
- I'm building **react-shiki**, a fast and flexible client-focused syntax highlighter for React.  
  It provides a clean component API like react-syntax-highlighter, alongside a more flexible React hook, bringing the modern, powerful Shiki syntax highlighter to React in an elegant and intuitive package.

- I’m also a **Founding Engineer at assistant-ui**, where we’re raising the bar for developer experience (DX) and accessibility in AI chat.  
  It’s a powerful SDK paired with a shadcn-style UI library, giving you everything you need to spin up an advanced, type-safe chat app with best-in-class design, accessibility, and performance.
